  Decision Tree - Heart Disease Prediction
Overview

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict heart disease based on patient data. The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate. The notebook covers data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
